# Customer Segmentation and Valuation

This is a quick simple customer segmention and customer valuation project for a flash deal website that's been in business for about 6 years.

I briefly explore the data set to get sense of proportions and trends. The segmentation and valuation techniques are based on an
ESSEC University course in Business Analytics. 

There are two versions. One with all orders, and one with US orders only. The US version gives a more realistic picture of customer trends because for the first 4 years international shipping was priced too low. That lead to an unsustainable revenue growth before, and to an exagerated revenue drop after, the pricing issue was corrected. Today international orders make up only about 10% of orders.
